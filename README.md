🥁 Drum Kit – Interactive Web App

Tech Stack: HTML • CSS • Vanilla JavaScript

📌 Overview

The Drum Kit is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to play drum sounds directly from their keyboard. Each key on the keyboard is mapped to a different drum sound, creating a fun and engaging musical experience.

🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of fundamental web technologies, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio integration in JavaScript.

✨ Key Features

Keyboard Interaction: Pressing specific keys triggers unique drum sounds.

Visual Feedback: Active keys highlight or animate to show user interaction.

Responsive Layout: Clean and simple UI designed for all screen sizes.

Lightweight & Fast: Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript without external libraries.

🛠️ What I Learned

How to use JavaScript event listeners (e.g., keydown, transitionend).

DOM manipulation to update UI elements dynamically.

Playing audio files using the JavaScript Audio object.

Building a small interactive project using only HTML, CSS, and JS.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add mobile tap support.

Add more instruments or sound packs.

Add recording + playback functionality.

Add simple animations using CSS transitions.
